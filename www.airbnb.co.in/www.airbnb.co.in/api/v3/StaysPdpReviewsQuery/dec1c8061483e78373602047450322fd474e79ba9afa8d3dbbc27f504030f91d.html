stayed at Jane's place for a week during Christmas 2024. We are a family of 6 with four children aged 12-20. The Villa is clean and spacious, the beds are comfortable. The kitchen has a water filter tap which is really useful. The outside space is great,
whilst you are really close to the city centre you are surrounded by trees in the garden by the pool so you dont really feel overlooked. The pool is great, particularly at the end of a busy day out-and-about. In terms of location the villa is perfect.
You are about a 5 minute walk into town, just by the Maya retail centre, with all the restaurants and bars. You can grab a taxi really easily either on the grab/bolt app or just hail a cab on the main street. The journey into the city centre to see the
temples/markets or to one of the local elephant sanctuaries is straight forward. As noted by other visitors, the villa is under the flight path, the planes are loud but dont fly late at night and it really didnt bother us.","id":"1320747139104917444","language":"en","createdAt":"2024-12-27T06:48:48Z","reviewee":{"__typename":"ReviewUser","deleted":false,"firstName":"Jane","hostName":"Jane","id":"42877033","pictureUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/42877033/profile_pic/1440934827/original.jpg","profilePath":"/users/show/42877033","isSuperhost":false,"userProfilePicture":{"__typename":"Image","baseUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/users/42877033/profile_pic/1440934827/original.jpg","onPressAction":{"__typename":"NavigateToUserProfile","url":"/users/show/42877033"}}},"reviewer":{"__typename":"ReviewUser","deleted":false,"firstName":"Danny","hostName":"Danny","id":"55394114","pictureUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/8c133242-0c41-4521-ad47-bbffcf3e6651.jpg","profilePath":"/users/show/55394114","isSuperhost":false,"userProfilePicture":{"__typename":"Image","baseUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/8c133242-0c41-4521-ad47-bbffcf3e6651.jpg","onPressAction":{"__typename":"NavigateToUserProfile","url":"/users/show/55394114"}}},"reviewHighlight":null,"highlightType":null,"localizedDate":"December

had a great time staying at Jane’s place for 5 nights. Although it’s a bit pricey since we only have a few people sharing, but the location and the house itself are all worth it. Nothing can beat the location in an upmarket neighbourhood only a few minutes
walk to a lovely shopping/dining of Nimman. The house is comfortable & clean with a lot of space to move around. The pool & all other amenities are great. There are just a couple of minor issues such as the lack of hooks for hanging things in bathrooms,
and the fact that swimming is not allowed after 8pm. But overall this is a great place especially for large groups.
